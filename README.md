## Taking image snapshots of Storybook

Screenshotting your RN app requires a few steps:

1. Start the RN version with `EXPO_PUBLIC_STORYBOOK_SNAPSHOT=1`. `EXPO_PUBLIC_STORYBOOK_SNAPSHOT` removes Storybook's UI for cleaner screenshots.

```sh
EXPO_PUBLIC_STORYBOOK_SNAPSHOT=1 npm run storybook:ios
```

2. After the RN version is running, run the snapshot tool, which will loop over the stories and save them into the `screenshots` directory.

```sh
npm run snapshot-storybook
```
